                                                    <h4>How does a ULIP Work?</h4>
                                                    <p>A ULIP works on 2 fronts – a) towards providing a life cover
                                                        through adequate insurance and b) towards wealth building</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <p>Initially for the first few years a good part of the premium is
                                                        allocated towards meeting policy expenses. Once these expenses
                                                        are deducted the balance premium is divided between proving life
                                                        insurance and making an investment. You choose a fund depending
                                                        on your risk appetite and you</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <p>The premium in a ULIP goes towards meeting the insurance needs
                                                        and towards building wealth. In the initial policy years you may
                                                        not see very high returns as a good part of the premium goes
                                                        towards policy expenses. But since you will remain invested for
                                                        a long term, the returns you reap by far exceed normal insurance
                                                        plans through fund management.</p>

                                                        an investment after expenses are deducted. Units are allocated
                                                        for the amount invested, in a fund of your choice. The fund
                                                        could be equity, debt, or a combination of the two. The value of
                                                        the units allocated depends on the performance of the underlying
